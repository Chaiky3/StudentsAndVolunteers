Dear {0}!

Thank you for agreeing to speak on a regular basis with my students in order to help them improve their oral proficiency.

I have given your contact information to {1} {2} who will hopefully contact you soon.

If you do not hear from {1}, please let me know and I will hook you up with someone else.

Your willingness to invest time in these students means a lot. These students will eventually become English teachers and will teach the next generation of Israelis, so your help will impact the national level of oral proficiency in Israel!

THANK YOU
